## Using Editori.AI

Search any topic in the initial landing page and learn the New York Times attitude towards it. Let them know whether you disagree or agree by sending your AI-generated letter to the editor. View a feed of other letters and vote on the best ones!

## Tech Stack

This web application uses the Django Web Framework with a React front end. The New York Times provides an API that allows for headline and article search. The OpenAI API provides sentiment analysis of the headlines and article content. The banner font League Spartan is from [The League of Moveable Type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-spartan). The hamburger menu uses the react-burger-menu library. All SVGs were converted to React components by [transform.tools](https://transform.tools/).

## Motivation

The New York Times provides their API to encourage the public to find and tell their own stories. My application expands on this mission by easily allowing users to generate letters to the editor that reflect their own opinion on the journalism produced by the New York Times.
